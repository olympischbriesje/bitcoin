Filter facts from fiction and bring this to the public from the vision the core developers.
Mainstream messages are diffused. There must be an haven of information about the truth of Bitcoin broadcasted by the core of Bitcoin.

If the public doesnt trust a key issue of Bitcoin, then this must be addressed by the bone of the core. Example, how do we know the limit is set by 21 million BTC:
      good Answer= false: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a62649731fb1babaedff10b7c0baec4c50c90d60/src/miner.cpp#L486 
                    but how the hack must the common man understand this line? Artists are needed here.
                      Translate this line of code into common human understanding for all languages and nations.
      Good Answer= true: artist + https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/a62649731fb1babaedff10b7c0baec4c50c90d60/src/miner.cpp#L486

The call for more genius artists and communicators is to bridge correct exposure of Bitcoin to the world 
by consensus of core development.

How to show the (r)evolution of Bitcoin Core and its penetration in running systems over the world
in a spectaculair interactive manner. All expressions of art are aproved by owner(s) of ID or repository.



To call or to be called. 
    case.contributors.devcall, Core developers call for help on communicating a repository; the developers sense the high priority and wants the public to understand.
             artists dive into the message and translate this to the public on the genius communication skills. 
               result to be approved by consensus of contributors
             artists work approved and merge into github
    case.contributors.undevcall
    
    
    case.contributors.devcalled, artist think the communication of a masterpiece of repository sucks. Artists show their communictation skills reflecting the repository
             devcalled examine the work of artists (perhaps justin beeper, obama, puppy doll, some smell, anything reflects perfectly the repository)
                result to be approved by consensus of contributors
             devcalled approves work of artists and merge into github 
     case.contributors.undevalled       



Merge Gource and Google Earth/maps, sample:
     case.contributor.Gavin,  http://youtu.be/NFFyMmiOSi8?t=54s Gavin.onclick="https://github.com/gavinandresen";
          artists contributions are merged by consensus.onhold. Gavin holds key to accept consensus and merge to core. 
          
    case.repository.qt, ...up to artist to translate the vision of the coders into any Visual, sound, ... Art.onclick="";
          artists contributions are merged by consensus.onhold. Repository.contributers holds key to accept consensus and merge to core.

First time stamped art on Bitcoin Core,
